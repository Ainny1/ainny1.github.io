### About Me:  
Hello, human. I’m ainny1 your friendly neighborhood packet whisperer.  
I spend my days fortifying the cloud, decrypting chaos, and occasionally talking to my terminal like it's a pet.

Fun facts:
- I’ve patched more vulnerabilities than I’ve had hot dinners.
- I once social-engineered my way into free tacos.
- I speak fluent Python, sarcasm, and firewall rules.
