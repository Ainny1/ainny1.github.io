## Hey there! Iâ€™m Mary-Cynthia

Iâ€™m a cybersecurity enthusiast with a flair for solving complex problems and making networks behave. With a unique background in Public Relations and a sharp technical toolkit, I bring the best of both worlds: clear communication *and* ironclad defense.

Whether it's scanning web forms for sneaky XSS payloads or securing cloud environments, Iâ€™m all about blending curiosity, creativity, and code to make the digital world safer â€” one vulnerability at a time.

## ðŸ§  Featured Projects (AKA my Cyber Lab Creations)

### [Advanced Web Form Vulnerability Scanner](https://github.com/Ainny1/AdvancedWebFormVulnerabilityScanner)
A Python-powered scanner that hunts down XSS and SQLi like a digital bloodhound.  
<em>Why I built it:</em> To sharpen my offensive skills and help defenders think like attackers.

### Network Monitoring Toolkit *(Coming Soon)*
A snazzy Python + Wireshark combo to track real-time network traffic.  
<em>Think of it as a radar for sneaky packets.</em>

### [TryHackMe Labs](https://tryhackme.com/p/Ainny1)
Completed over 70 hands-on labs on topics like privilege escalation, web app pentesting, and SOC operations.  
<em>Learning by hacking responsibly â€” and loving every second of it!</em>
