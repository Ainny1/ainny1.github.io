⚔ About Me
Cybersecurity isn’t just my career — it’s my battlefield.
I’m a digital guardian with a flair for public-facing comms and a love for
offensive tactics, blue team defense, and cloud hardening.
From intercepting rogue payloads to crafting custom scanners, I mix
creativity, curiosity, and code to fortify systems and help others do the
same.
